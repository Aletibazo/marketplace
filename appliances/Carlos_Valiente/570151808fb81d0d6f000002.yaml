name: CoreOS alpha
version: 1000.0.0
publisher: Carlos Valiente
description: |-
  Password for user `core` is disabled. You will need an SSH key in order to
  log in.

  This image works best with two network interfaces defined:

  * The first network interface will be used as CoreOS' private IPv4
    address.
  * If there is a second network interface defined, it will be used as
    CoreOS' public IPv4 network.

  The VM template bundled with this image includes a `USER_DATA` field, with
  which you may pass extra
  [cloud-config](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html)
  user data to configure your CoreOS instance.
