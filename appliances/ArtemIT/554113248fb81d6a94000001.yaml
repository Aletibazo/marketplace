  information.\n\nOpenNebula's contextualization script for Ubuntu has been
  modified, so interface settings are inserted into VyOS configuration file.
  Also if SSH key contextualization is selected a ssh pub key is added to
  the vyos user.\n\n\nINFO & LOGIN\n\nThe recommended minimum system requirements
  are 512MB RAM and 2GB storage.\n\nThe image provides an OS image that
  you can use as a HDD that you can add as storage to a template and deploy
  a VyOS router.\n\nThe interface IP address is assigned to the VM from
  the contextualization ISO or using the MAC_PREFFIX:IP rule (using the
  last four octets of the MAC address) and a Class C mask is used for network
  mask. \n\nYou must log in with vyos user and the password vyos. \n\nYou
  can safely ignore the: Failed to access perfctt msr message.\n\nWARNING:
  \n\nThe settings are not persistent unless you enter the conf level and
  use the save command. Once you save the configuration, please use the
  following command to stop the execution of the contextualization script,
  so it doesn't break your router's configuration on boot:\nsudo cat /dev/null
  > /opt/vyatta/etc/config/scripts/vyatta-postconfig-bootup.script\n\nThis
