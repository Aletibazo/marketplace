description: "This image has been created using VyOS 1.0.5 ISO for 64 bits
  so you can deploy a virtual router and firewall. \n\nOpenNebula's contextualization
  script for Ubuntu has been modified, so interface settings are inserted
  into VyOS configuration file. Also if SSH key contextualization is selected
  a ssh pub key is added to the vyos user.\n\nThe recommended system requirements
  are 512MB RAM and 2GB storage.\n\nThe interface IP address is assigned
  to the VM from the contextualization ISO or using the MAC_PREFFIX:IP rule
  (using the last four octets of the MAC address) and a Class C mask is
  used for network mask. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must log in with vyos user and
  the password vyos. \n\nWARNING: The settings are not persistent unless
  you enter the conf level and use the save command. Once you save the configuration,
  please use the following command to stop the execution of the contextualization
  script, so it doesn't break your router's configuration on boot:\n\nsudo
  cat /dev/null > /opt/vyatta/etc/config/scripts/vyatta-postconfig-bootup.script\n\nThis

  a VyOS virtual router/firewall for KVM."
