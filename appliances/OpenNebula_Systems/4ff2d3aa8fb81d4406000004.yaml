description: "This is a very small image that works with OpenNebula. It's
  already contextualized. The purpose of this image is to test OpenNebula
  deployments, without wasting network bandwith thanks to the tiny footprint
  of this image\n(100MB).\n\nThe login information for this image is:\n\n*
  **login**: root\n* **password**: password\n\n\nThe image is prepared to
  mount a contextualization CD from `hdb` device an execute `init.sh`.\n\nExample
  of contextualization file that includes info about the public network
  interface and the public ssh key of a user:\n\n    CONTEXT = [\n      hostname
  \ = \"$NAME\",\n      ip_public = \"$NIC[IP, NETWORK=\\\"Public\\\"]\",\n
  \     username  = virtualuser,\n      files     = \"/vms_configuration/id_rsa.pub
  /vms_configuration/init.sh\"\n    ]\n\nThe `init.sh` script that goes
  with this configuration. It configures the IP of the public network and
  creates the user. Also adds the public ssh key so it can be accessed externally:\n\n
  \   #!/bin/bash\n \n    if [ -f /mnt/context.sh ]; then\n      . /mnt/context.sh\n
  \   fi\n \n    hostname $HOSTNAME\n    ifconfig eth0 $IP_PUBLIC\n \n    useradd
  -m $USERNAME\n \n    mkdir -p ~$USERNAME/.ssh\n    cat /mnt/id_rsa.pub
  >> ~$USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys\n \n    chown -R $USERNAME /home/$USERNAME"
