  The Carina Environment Manager is a component to handle the deployment
  of interconnected multi-VM application services on top of the OpenNebula
  IaaS platform. It supports the automated creation and run-time scaling
  of multi-VM application environments according to policies. It leverages
  the OpenNebula contextualization framework to setup clusters of VMs in
  a master-slave configuration or a set of workers with an IP load-balancer
  in front. Policies can be defined to control how VMs are added or removed
  based on manual, time of day, or application load-based triggers.
